        individual tags. Each tag is analyzed in isolation. Only tags which contain known job names (from a whitelist)
        or variants of them are considered. A tag can contain several job names or variants.
        For each tag the relevant features are extracted. Relevant features can be:
        - the name of the tag
        - the number of occurrences for the individual matches
        Classification is then made by calculating a score based on the extracted features. The vacancy is classified
        as the job name with the highest occurrence from the tag with the highest score."""
